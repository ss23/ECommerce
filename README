This is a not fully functional ecommerce system, specifcally for the sale of services rather than things.
The example used throughout the project is webhosting or something of the like.

This isn’t even anywhere close to an alpha release.

To function, it will need smarty installed and paths configured in htdocs/ecommerce/index.php.
Database details are configured near the bottom of smarty/ecom/libs/config.php.

Pages are made by first creating a “Controller”. They can be modelled after the HomeController, but should
be fine as long as you’re extending MainController. Inheritance can be used in this way, for example,
PlanController extends MainController. ServicesController extends MainController.

I’ve spent a considerable time on the databaes design too, in the hope that it’s going to make further
development easier.

Update — Set your document root to www/htdocs and make sure that www/write and www/htdocs/assets are writeable!
